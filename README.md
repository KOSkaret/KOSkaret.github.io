This project will be my portfolio page, wich I will host here.

## Requirements

In this task I have four requirements.
Which is where I am able to:

- Access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

- Click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

- See thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)

- Navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
